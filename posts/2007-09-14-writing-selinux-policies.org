title: Writing SELinux policies

I started the adventure of writing an SELinux security policy from
scratch today. This is on CentOS 5, which uses the new policy modules
approach rather than the older scheme involved a huge number of policies
and a Makefile.`

It took hours of searching on the Net to find out that there's really
nothing out there to teach you how to start a new policy from nothing. I
found one "step-by-step" guide, but it involved using a GUI tool that I
don't have. Every other article on writing policy is about using
=audit2allow= to make existing policies more permissive.

The missing piece turned out to be the package =selinux-policy-devel=,
which installs a tree of macro files in =/usr/share/selinux/devel=.
Going into there, I found a complete example policy! So I copied these
example files and started configuring them for Trac, the Python daemon I
want to lock down. After that, I just had to run make, and insert the
new policy using "=semodule -i trac.pp=". And now it looks like I'm in
for a few days of tweaking, as I narrow down exactly what Trac does and
doesn't need to be able to do.
