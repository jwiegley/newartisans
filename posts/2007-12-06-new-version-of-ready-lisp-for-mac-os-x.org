title: New version of Ready Lisp for Mac OS X

There is a new version of Ready Lisp for Mac OS X available. This
version is based on SBCL 1.0.12.17, and requires OS X Leopard 10.5. The
most notable change from the previous version is that it is now fully
universal, supporting PowerPC and 32- bit and 64-bit Intel machines.
Also, threading has been turned on for Intel processor. See the NEWS
below.

What is Ready Lisp? It's a binding together of several popular Lisp
packages for OS X, including: Aquamacs, SBCL and SLIME. Once downloaded,
you'll have a single application bundle which you can double-click --
and find yourself in a fully configured Common Lisp REPL. It's ideal for
OS X users who want to try out Lisp with a minimum of hassle.
[[ftp://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/lisp/ReadyLisp-1.0.12-10.5.1.dmg][The
download]] is approximately 87 megabytes.

There is a GnuPG signature for this file in the same directory; append
=.asc= to the above filename to download it. To install my public key
onto your keyring, use this command:

#+begin_example
$ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv 0x824715A0
#+end_example

Once installed, you can verify the download using the following command:

#+begin_example
$ gpg --verify ReadyLisp-1.0.12-10.5.1.dmg.asc
#+end_example

Below is a full rundown of what's new.

** Now fully universal
Ready Lisp is now fully universal, and runs on the following platforms:

- Intel 64-bit
- Intel 32-bit
- PowerPC 32-bit

There is no port of SBCL to 64-bit PowerPC. Experimental threading has
been enabled for both Intel platforms.

** Updated versions
The following pieces were updated:

- SBCL, to version 1.0.12.17
- SLIME, to CVS version 2007-12-06

Aquamacs remains at version 1.2a.

** Full Info documentation
Info documentation for the Common Lisp pieces is now bundled in. Just
type =C-h i= to read it. Also, when editing Common Lisp files, you can
type =C-h f= to instantly access the HyperSpec index. In Emacs Lisp
files, =C-h f= will get you help on Emacs Lisp functions.

There is also HTML and PDF versions of all documentation in:

- =Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/html=
- =Ready Lisp.app/Contents/Resources/doc=

** More libraries
There are a few more Common Lisp libraries bundled in the core file with
this release:

- =CL-FAD=
- =LOCAL-TIME=
- =SERIES=
- =MEMOIZE=
- =CL-PPCRE=

I find these libraries very handy, but mainly I'm including them because
the upcoming release of my CL-Ledger accounting tool depends on them, so
it will work for Ready Lisp users out-of-the-box. See the "doc"
subdirectory above for documentation on how to use these libraries
(except =MEMOIZE=, which does not have separate documentation; use
=memoize:memoize-function= to mark a function as memoized).
