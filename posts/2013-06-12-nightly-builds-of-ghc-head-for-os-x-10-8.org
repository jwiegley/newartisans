title: Nightly builds of GHC HEAD for OS X 10.8
tags: tech, publish=newartisans

Since mid-January, I've been running nightly builds of GHC on my Mac Pro
for 10.8.x, 64-bit. I've decided to make these results publically
downloadable here: [[http://ghc.newartisans.com]].

The installer tarballs are in =dist=, while the fulltest and nofib logs
are in =logs=. According to Jenkins this build takes 8h15m minutes, so I
figured this might save others some CPU heat.
