title: Git from the bottom up
tags: tech
---

In my pursuit to understand Git, it's been helpful for me to understand
it from the bottom up -- rather than look at it only in terms of its
high-level commands. And since Git is so beautifully simple when viewed
this way, I thought others might be interested to read what I've found,
and perhaps avoid the pain I went through finding it.

[[http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf][The following
article]] offers what I've learned on this journey so far. I hope it can
help others to comprehend this wonderful system, and discover some of
the joy I've experienced in the past few weeks. *NOTE*: After receiving
more than fifty corrections by e-mail from very helpful readers, I've
updated the PDF to reflect their input. The date at the front should
read "December 2009" if you have the latest version.

Here is a summary from the table of contents:

- Introduction
