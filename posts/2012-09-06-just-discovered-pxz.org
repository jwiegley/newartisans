title: Just discovered pxz

To show just how significant parallelized algorithms can be, today I
discovered [[http://jnovy.fedorapeople.org/pxz/][pxz]], a parallelized
version of the =xz= compression utility, which I use constantly. The
proof is in the numbers:

#+begin_html
  <!--more-->
#+end_html

| Command    | Before      | After     | Ratio       | Time      |
|------------+-------------+-----------+-------------+-----------|
| xz pxz -9e | 2937M 2937M | 305M 281M | 0.104 0.096 | 32m 4m(!) |

I put this alias in my =.zshrc=:

#+begin_example
alias tar='tar --use-compress-program=pxz'
#+end_example

Note that to build =pxz= on the Mac, I had to comment out a reference to
=MAP_POPULATE=, which the OS X's =mmap= function doesn't support.
