title: Update of gitlib libraries on Hackage, plus git-monitor
tags: tech
---

I've decided after many months of active development to release version
1.0.1 of gitlib and its related libraries to Hackage. There is still
more code review to done, and /much/ documentation to be written, but
this gets the code out there, which has been working very nicely at FP
Complete for about six months now.

The more exciting tool for users may be the =git-monitor= utility, which
passively and efficiently makes one-minute snapshots of a single Git
working tree while you work. I use it continually for the repositories I
work on during the day. Just run =git-monitor -v= in a terminal window,
and start making changes. After about a minute you should see commit
notifications appearing in the terminal window.
