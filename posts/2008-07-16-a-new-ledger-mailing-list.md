title: A new Ledger mailing list
category: Uncategorized

The Ledger project now has a new mailing list, hosted at [Google Groups][].  This was requested by several users who were not happy with the current web forums being used.  Note that you do not have to join the group just to post a question.  I’ll be keeping the web forums up for another year or so, but will start discouraging their use.

Also, you can find a few of us on IRC at **irc.freenode.net**, on the channel **#ledger**.  My own nick is “johnw”.  Come say hello!
