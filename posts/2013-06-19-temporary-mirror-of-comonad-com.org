Until [[http://comonad.com][the Comonad Reader]] comes back online, I
have a temporary mirror setup at [[http://comonad.newartisans.com]].
It's a bit old (Sep 2012), but has some classics like "Free Monads for
Less". It is missing the "Algebra of Applicatives", though, since I
hadn't run the mirror in a while.
