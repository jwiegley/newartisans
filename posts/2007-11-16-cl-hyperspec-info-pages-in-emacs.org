title: CL HyperSpec Info pages in Emacs

I just discovered the [[http://bc.tech.coop/blog/031002.html][following
blog article]] by Bill Clementson, from way back in 2003. Luckily, the
links still worked, so I was able to get Info pages today for the Common
Lisp HyperSpec courtesy of the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/][GCL]]
project.

Once installed, I found I could not easily lookup documentation for,
say, =mapcar=, because it's actually on the page for =mapc=. But
[[http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][SLIME]]'s =hyperspec.el=
contained the indexing info I needed to write a new module which fires
up the Info system on the correct section for the symbol you want
defined.

This new module is called =cl-info.el= and is available
[[ftp://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/emacs/cl-info.el][from my Lisp
repository]]. It rebinds the standard Emacs key for function help
(=C-h f=) to lookup help in the HyperSpec instead, if you're in a
=lisp-mode= buffer.

*NOTE*: A fellow Lisper pointed me to
[[http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/log/programming/lisp/dpans-texinfo-edition][this
blog entry]] which offers a much nicer way to get the HyperSpec in Info
form. It's a little more work, but the quality of the result is superior
and it has an index! Also, it makes my =cl-info.el= unnecessary, by
relying entirely on the Info system itself.
