Ledger 2.6.1 is released today. This is a bug fix release only, which
fixes some blocking issues relating to the =-p= and =-e= options. It is
a recommended upgrade for all Ledger users. It may be downloaded
[[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=112869][here]]

Work now turns fully to the upcoming 3.0 release, which represents a
substantial code cleanup and rationalization of the user interface and
several internal facilities. It will also focus on Python integration
and better value expression handling.
