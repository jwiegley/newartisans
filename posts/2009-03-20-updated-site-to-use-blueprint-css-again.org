title: Updated site to use Blueprint CSS again
---

Recently I changed how the content on this site was generated, from
using the standalone OS X application
[[http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/][RapidWeaver]], to the
server-side publishing platform [[http://www.movabletype.org/][Movable
Type]]. During that transition I changed the site's style to the
minimalist default offered by MT, which uses its own CSS for column
layout and typography.

Tonight I finally got around to switching the site back to
[[http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/][blueprint-css]], which
I very much prefer. I used the superb application
[[http://macrabbit.com/cssedit/][CSSEdit]] to help me massage Movable
Type's style into something that compatible with Blueprint's own
typography and layout.

I hope the result is pleasing. If anyone sees strange artifacts or
display issues, please [[mailto:johnw@newartisans.com][let me know]].
I'm aware code examples were being truncated on the right side before,
but this should be corrected now. More on Haskell to come soon!
