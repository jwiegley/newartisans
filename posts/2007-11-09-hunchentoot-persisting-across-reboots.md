title: "Hunchentoot: Persisting across reboots"
---

In my earlier article on running Hunchentoot behind Apache, I mentioned that it would not be very difficult to have Common Lisp persist your runtime state across a system reboot.  Well, after a bit of work, I now have that support available.  I've [revised the article](http://www.newartisans.com/2007/11/running-common-lisp-behind-apache.html) to reflect these changes, so please read there for more information!
