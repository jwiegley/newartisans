title: Run the Spotlight indexer at a lower priority
---

I realized the other day that on OS X, the Spotlight indexing process is
started using =launchd=. This makes it very easy to modify the =launchd=
configuration script to insure that background indexing uses the least
amount of CPU and I/O bandwidth possible.

Edit the configuration script by running this command as root:

#+begin_example
# open /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist
#+end_example

You should find yourself in the Property List Editor application. Now
add two keys at the top-level, one named *LowPriorityIO*, which is a
boolean set to true, and another named *Nice* which should be an integer
set to 20.

Now whenever the =mds= spawns =mdworker= processes to index recent
changes to the file system, it won't get in your way quite as much as
before. (Without this change, =mdworker= processes run at the same
priority as user processes, according to output from the =ps axl=
command).
