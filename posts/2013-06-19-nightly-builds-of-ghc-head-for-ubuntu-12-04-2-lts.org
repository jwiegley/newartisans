title: Nightly builds of GHC HEAD for Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS
---

Chatting with merijn on #haskell, I realized I have a file server
running Ubuntu in a VM that's idle most of the time, so I decided to set
up a jenkins user there and make use of it as a build slave in the
evenings. This means that at [[http://ghc.newartisans.com]], you'll now
find nightly builds of GHC HEAD for Ubuntu as well (64-bit). It also
includes fulltest and nofib results for each build.
