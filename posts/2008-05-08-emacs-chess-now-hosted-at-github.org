title: Emacs Chess now hosted at GitHub
tags: tech
---

Emacs Chess is a fully featured chess client written entirely in Emacs
Lisp. You can use it to play against other people on freechess.org, or
against popular chess engines like gnuchess and crafty. It supports
graphical rendering of chess boards within Emacs (in 2D), ASCII
displays, and even electronic chess boards, or producing output
appropriate braille for readers. Adding a new back-end is trivial. It
also comes with a library for inspecting and reasoning about chess
positions.

This project is looking for someone who loves Emacs, Lisp and the game
of chess, to fork it and take over as maintainer. The FSF has agreed to
include Emacs Chess as part of the Emacs distribution, but I've held off
because of a few remaining issues I want to see resolved before it goes
mainstream. It does work quite well, however, and I have friends who use
it as their sole client for playing chess online.

Emacs Chess is now being hosted at GitHub, which should make it easier
for others to contribute:

#+begin_example
http://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-chess
#+end_example

If you'd like to just clone it and try it out, run the following and
then see the README:

#+begin_example
git clone git://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-chess.git
cd emacs-chess
git submodule init
git submodule update      # grab the 2D pieces and sound sets
make
#+end_example

After it compiles, add the =emacs-chess= directory to your =load-path=,
load =chess.el=, and then type =M-x chess=!

If anyone is interested in taking over as the maintainer, or would like
to contribute those last few weeks of work necessary to getting this
project delivered with GNU Emacs, please contact me.
