title: Fixed a few bugs in Ready Lisp
tags: tech, publish=newartisans
---

A couple of pathname issues were discovered in the release of Ready Lisp
that was posted yesterday, leading to the inability to load
=asdf-install= (or use it). These have been fixed in the new release
uploaded today. If you now use =asdf-install= and choose a "system-wide"
installation, the installed packages get saved in your Application
bundle. However, due to the way that =asdf-install= itself works, if you
then move your application bundle to another directory, symbolic links
in the =systems= directory will get broken. So I recommend installing
new packages into your home directory instead.

Also, the sources for SBCL are now included, meaning that if you use
=M-.= (jump to definition) and pick a function like =mapcar=, it will
drop you into the source code for SBCL's =mapcar= implementation.

The new version is available
[[ftp://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/lisp/ReadyLisp-1.0.12-10.5.1-2.dmg][here]]
(the old link still works, it is now a reference to that one).

Lastly, I've created a new home page for the Ready Lisp project, which
now lives [[http://www.newartisans.com/software/readylisp.html][here]].
