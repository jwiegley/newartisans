title: Ready Lisp version 20080428 now available
---

There is a new version of Ready Lisp for Mac OS X available. This
version is based on SBCL 1.0.16, and requires OS X Leopard 10.5. The
most notable change from the previous version is that 64-bit mode and
experimental threading are no longer supported, since both have been
known to have issues on OS X, while the purpose of Ready Lisp is to
smoothly introduce Common Lisp to new users.

What is Ready Lisp? It's a binding together of several popular Lisp
packages for OS X, including: Aquamacs, SBCL and SLIME. Once downloaded,
you'll have a single application bundle which you can double-click --
and find yourself in a fully configured Common Lisp REPL. It's ideal for
OS X users who want to try out Lisp with a minimum of hassle.
