title: "Script of the week: sizes"

For the next few months, I will have a "script of the week" each week:
just some tiny little scripts I've developed over the years that I
happen to find particularly useful.

Today's is a shell script called =sizes=. It's a fairly simplistic
interface to the =du= commands which just shows you all files and
directories in the current directory that are larger than one megabyte.

#+begin_html
  <!--more-->
#+end_html

Here's an example of running it in my =/Library= directory:

#+begin_example
~/Library $ sizes
2.8M   Scripts
3.9M   Components
5.6M   Java
6.0M   QuickTime
6.1M   PreferencePanes
7.6M   TexPackages
 12M   Keychains
 15M   Fonts
 20M   Preferences
 36M   Logs
 51M   Lisp
 55M   Emacs
 86M   Backups
398M   Application Support
1.7G   Caches
#+end_example

Here's the script:

#+begin_example
#!/bin/sh

du -shx * .[a-zA-Z0-9_]* 2> /dev/null | \
    egrep '^ *[0-9.]*[MG]' | sort -n > /tmp/sizes.$$

egrep '^ *[0-9.]*M' /tmp/sizes.$$
egrep '^ *[0-9.]*G' /tmp/sizes.$$

rm -f /tmp/sizes.$$
#+end_example
