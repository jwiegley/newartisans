title: Run times for Hello, World in 2009

Someone recently asked what my issue was regarding the JVM, since at the
moment it prevents me from falling too much in love with
[[http://clojure.org][Clojure]] -- a language with the double-benefits
of functional programming, and Lisp syntax and macros.

Well, below is my reason. These may not seem like much time in the
scheme of things, but psychologically it builds up on me when I have to
run a particular script over and over and over again. I've already
noticed the pain with Groovy.

| Language              | Running time     |
|-----------------------+------------------|
| C                     | 0.00415675640106 |
| C++                   | 0.0043337225914  |
| Haskell (compiled)    | 0.00494946241379 |
| Perl                  | 0.00773874521255 |
| Ruby (1.8.7)          | 0.00913717746735 |
| Ruby (1.9.1-p0)       | 0.0196997523308  |
| Python                | 0.0269904136658  |
| ECL (Common Lisp)     | 0.126332080364   |
| Java (JDK6)           | 0.146584188938   |
| Haskell (interpreted) | 0.20009740591    |
| Groovy (JDK6)         | 1.07791568041    |

If you'd like to generate some of these timings for your own system, I
have created a [[http://github.com/jwiegley/helloworld][Hello, world
project on GitHub]].
