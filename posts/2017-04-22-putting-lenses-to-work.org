title: Putting lenses to work

I gave a talk a couple of weeks ago at BayHac 2017 on "Putting lenses to
work", to show in a practical context how we use lenses at my workplace.
I specifically avoided any theory about lenses, or the complex types, or
the many operators, to show that at its core, lens is a truly invaluable
library:

The [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZy4Yml3LTY][video is now
available on YouTube]], and
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/putting-lenses-to-work][slides for the
talk are on GitHub]].

The code in the slides are taken directly (using Emacs) from a test file
in that same repository,
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/putting-lenses-to-work/blob/master/Lenses.hs][Lenses.hs]],
to serve as a way of preserving helpful examples, and to make it easy to
cargo cult specific patterns into your code.
