Ledger 2.6.1 is released today.  This is a bug fix release only, which fixes some blocking issues relating to the `-p` and `-e` options.  It is a recommended upgrade for all Ledger users.  It may be downloaded [here][]

Work now turns fully to the upcoming 3.0 release, which represents a substantial code cleanup and rationalization of the user interface and several internal facilities.  It will also focus on Python integration and better value expression handling.
