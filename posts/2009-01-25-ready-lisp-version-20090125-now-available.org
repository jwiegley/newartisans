What is Ready Lisp? It's a binding together of several popular Lisp
packages for OS X, including: Aquamacs, SBCL and SLIME. Once downloaded,
you'll have a single application bundle which you can double-click --
and find yourself in a fully configured Common Lisp REPL. It's ideal for
OS X users who want to try out Lisp with a minimum of hassle.
