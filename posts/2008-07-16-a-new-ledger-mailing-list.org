title: A new Ledger mailing list
---

The Ledger project now has a new mailing list, hosted at
[[http://groups.google.com/group/ledger-cli/][Google Groups]]. This was
requested by several users who were not happy with the current web
forums being used. Note that you do not have to join the group just to
post a question. I'll be keeping the web forums up for another year or
so, but will start discouraging their use.

Also, you can find a few of us on IRC at *irc.freenode.net*, on the
channel *#ledger*. My own nick is "johnw". Come say hello!
